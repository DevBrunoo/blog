  <h1>Ways to make bitcoins in automatic mode</h1>
  <p>There are basically two ways to earn bitcoins in an automated way. The first is through mining and the second is through trade robots (bots), which carry out bitcoin buying and selling operations.</p>
  <h2>First way: Mining</h2>
  <p>Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction logs to Bitcoinâ€™s public ledger, which stores past transactions. This ledger is called Blockchain because it is a chain of transaction/record blocks.</p>
  <p>The main activities that miners must do are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Listen to transactions: Miners need to listen for transactions on the network and validate them by checking the signatures and whether the expenses have been spent previously.</li>
    <li>Keep the blockchain and listen for new blocks: Miners must maintain the blockchain by requesting transaction history from other nodes. They also listen for new blocks being broadcasted on the network and validate each block transaction.</li>
    <li>Assemble a new block: Miners group transactions they heard into a new block that extends the last known block and includes valid transactions.</li>
    <li>Find a nonce that makes the block valid: This step requires significant work and is where most of the difficulty for miners occurs.</li>
    <li>Hoping for the block to be accepted: Even if a miner found a block, there is no guarantee it will be part of the consensus chain. The miner must hope that other miners accept their block and start mining from it.</li>
    <li>Profit: If all miners accept a block, the miner who created it profits. The reward for a block varies, and in early 2015, it was 25 bitcoins.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Second way: Robots</h2>
  <p>Robots (bots) are software that receive information from the Bitcoin market to make decisions that generate profit. In other words, the robot uses the invested money to acquire more bitcoins by buying low and selling high.</p>
