<ol start="4">
  <li><strong>Limited editions and continuous editions</strong><br>
    Any artist knows that putting his art on a T-shirt, mug or cell phone case implies a great popularization of that work. However, some galleries like Spoke have opted for a limited edition model when reproducing the works of their artists.<br>
    “We work hard to find special arts and projects – and special things deserve special treatment. As much as the profits are higher with continuous editions, the limited editions help to increase the value of the pieces and works”.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Vary price</strong><br>
    Let’s jump to an example that is better to explain<br>
    Think that a possible buyer enters your store but he does not have much money and is not so excited to spend a lot of money, on the other hand you have some low priced gear that he may be interested in and buy, after some time that same buyer you can go back to your store and buy the most expensive ones.<br>
    Not to mention that this buyer of cheap art can make free advertising for your store talking about it to your friends and family, who knows, maybe even take a picture of the painting and post it on some social networks marking your store.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Be different</strong><br>
    If you make the same description and take the same pictures of art boards to sell on the internet it will be very difficult for you to stand out and be able to sell your art in large quantities the big secret and to reinvent yourself by taking pictures and creating descriptions that make your art is visited in different ways that will make the possible customer buy.<br>
    Another tip is to send your art with the most care and attention possible, be the best friend of your client and he will recommend and buy from you always.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Advertise your art</strong><br>
    It is good to note that if you want quick results, it is always good to think about advertising your works of art.
