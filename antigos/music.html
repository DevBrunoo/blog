<h1 class="musicpost1_titulo"> Discover how music reacts in the brain</h1>
<p>Music has a unique effect on the human brain. Dr. Andrew Budson, professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and Head of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at the VA Boston Healthcare System, explains that our brains can distinguish music from other noises and respond to rhythm and repetition of tones. Studies show that music triggers the release of dopamine in the striatum, an ancient part of the brain associated with pleasure. This means that listening to music can affect the same areas of the brain as chocolate, sex, and cocaine. Research using specificity combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity found that dopamine release in the striatum occurs at the peak of emotional arousal during music listening. The results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatum.</p>

<p>Music has been enjoyed by humans for many years, regardless of culture. Whether your choice is jazz, classical, rock 'n' roll or hip-hop, music has unique effects on the brain. Dr. Andrew Budson, professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and Head of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at the VA Boston Healthcare System, explains that our brains can distinguish music from other noises and respond to rhythm and repetition of tones and melodies. This is impressive from a scientific point of view because music does not contribute to our survival or reproduction. Studies show that music triggers the release of dopamine in the striatum, an ancient part of the brain associated with pleasure. This means that listening to music can affect the same areas of the brain as chocolate, sex, and cocaine. Research using specificity combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity found that dopamine release in the striatum occurs at the peak of emotional arousal during music listening. The results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatum.</p>
